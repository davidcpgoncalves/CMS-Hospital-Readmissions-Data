### Goal
This project's goal is to use SQL to identify high-risk conditions and facilities for target interventions in order to reduce 30-day readmissions, using the official *CMS readmissions reduction program dataset*.
### Process
(This will be updated as the project goes on) 
We will use Google's BigQuery (create a new project + data set) and we'll import the tables as CSV [Official website](https://data.cms.gov/).
# The Project
## 1. Problem framing and Business Questions
### 1.1 Objectives
1. Identify high-risk conditions (We'll have to define these)
2. Identify facilities that have those conditions for targeted interventions
3. Present our findings to the stakeholders
### 1.2 Project Name 

### 1.3 Scenario

### 1.4 Stakeholders

### 1.5 Problem Statement
How can we reduce 30-day readmission rates by identifying high-risk conditions and facilities for targeted interventions?
### 1.6 Sub-questions
1. **Size:** What is the overall 30-day readmission rate by condition and facility?
2. **Rank:** Which hospitals have the highest/lowest readmission rates?
3. **Explain:** Which conditions drive the most readmissions?
4. **Compare:** How do readmission rates vary by hospital characteristics (size, ownership, emergency services)?
5. **Recommend:** Which 3 facilities should prioritize readmission reduction programs?
## 2. Data Requirements and Gathering
### 2.1 Objectives
- Identify all necessary data
- Create a new project and dataset in Big Query
- Upload both CSVs 
### 2.2 Datasets
- Understand metadata from both datasets
## 3. Data Analysis
### 3.1 Exploring

### 3.2 Profiling

### 3.3 Cleaning

### 3.4 Shaping

### 3.5 Analyzing
