### Goal
This project's goal is to use SQL to identify high-risk conditions and facilities for target interventions in order to reduce 30-day readmissions, using the official *CMS readmissions reduction program dataset*.
### Process
(This will be updated as the project goes on) We will use Google's BigQuery (create a new project + data set) and we'll import the tables as CSV [Official website](https://data.cms.gov/).
